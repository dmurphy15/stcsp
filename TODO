OPTIMIZATION
Some algorithms have been implemented naively and could be optimized. For example, normalizing expressions
could maybe be made more efficient by detecting special cases of expression combinations, and getting the domain
of an expression could be made more efficient by overriding the default method for a particular expression that
takes advantage of what that expression does.

This implementation also performs faster on certain types of problems and slower on others - notably digiinvaders 
problems should be improved.

USABILITY
Currently, if you want to change the underlying data structure that represents a variable's domain,
you will have to go into types.h and swap in that data structure, then recompile the whole thing. This could
maybe be made simpler by supplying a Domain abstract class and allowing implementations to derive it, then
creating a domain factory, similar to how searchnode types are done.
