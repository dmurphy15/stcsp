TODO
make the propagate functions into a class that can be passed
make constraint chooser class
make variable chooser class
make value chooser class


LAYOUT:
solver gets the constraints
from the constraints, it gets variables
variables just have their domains - no evaluation or anything
solver creates instantaneous csps, each with their own set of constraints and all variables
each instantaneous csp makes its own map of variable to assignment


context handles all assignments



in makefile, generate all .o files plus the lex script that solves problems

ask Jasper what the deal was with Array variables wtf are those
